# Key rate calculation in QKD with Julia
This repository contains the Julia code used for calculating the key rate in quantum key distribution (QKD) under realistic noise models.
The code is based on a converging semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchy of lower bounds on the conditional von Neumann entropy with mutually unbiased bases (MUB). 
The project uses JuMP for modeling and the MOSEK solver to perform the necessary computations.

This code is part of my Bachelor's thesis in Physics.
