# Key rate calculation in QKD with Julia
This repository contains Julia code for calculating the key rate in quantum key distribution (QKD) under realistic noise models, as part of my Bachelor's thesis in Physics. The code is based on a converging semidefinite programming (SDP) hierarchy of lower bounds on the conditional von Neumann entropy with mutually unbiased bases (MUB). It uses JuMP for modeling and the MOSEK solver to perform the necessary computations.
